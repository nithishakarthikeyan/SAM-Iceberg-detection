**The Google Earth Engine image export script**

This script uses Google Earth Engine to extract Sentinel-1 SAR data over the Thwaites Glacier region for a chosen month. It starts by filtering the Sentinel-1 GRD image collection by location, date, instrument mode (IW), polarization (HH), and orbit pass (descending). Then, it takes the median of the pixel size over the month for all the images and outputs a single image. A small region of interest around the specified coordinates is defined for visualization and export. The script adds the clipped image layer to the map for a quick sanity check, and finally, it exports the processed image to the user’s GEE assets at 10-meter resolution for later use of segmentation and iceberg detection. 

**The SAM iceberg detection script**

This workflow combines Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Segment Anything (SAM) to extract, preprocess, and segment satellite imagery of the Thwaites Glacier region in Antarctica. First, Sentinel-1 radar images are loaded from GEE, filtered by date, polarization, and orbit, and then reduced using a median composite to minimize noise across the selected month. A bounding box around your point of interest is applied, and the image is clipped and exported as a GeoTIFF. The code also creates a visualization-friendly version of the SAR image (scaled to 0–255 values), ensuring it can be interpreted by machine learning models like SAM. At this stage, you essentially prepare a clean, analysis-ready subset of Sentinel-1 imagery from raw satellite data.

Next, the script applies Meta’s Segment Anything Model (via the segment-geospatial package) to automatically segment icebergs within the exported image. The output is a mask where each iceberg is represented as a labeled region. Using Python libraries like Rasterio, NumPy, and scikit-image, the code calculates the size of each segmented iceberg in square kilometers and builds a histogram of iceberg size distribution. Finally, Matplotlib overlays the detected icebergs on the SAR image and plots the histogram, giving you both a visual interpretation of iceberg locations and a quantitative analysis of their size distribution for the given month.
